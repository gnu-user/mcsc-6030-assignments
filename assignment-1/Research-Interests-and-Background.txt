I am a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at UOIT and I am still trying to finalize my thesis topic for
my MASc program.

My research interests are numerous, but in particular I am focusing on the following specifically: artificial intelligence, time series analysis, statistics
and number theory, big data, and evolutionary computation. My undergraduate degree was in software engineering , nd I find the application of artificial intelligence to large amounts of data in order to derive new insight very exciting and interesting.
