I am a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at UOIT and I am still trying to finalize my thesis topic for
my MASc program.

My research interests are numerous, but in particular I am focusing on the following specifically: artificial intelligence, time series analysis, statistics
and number theory, big data, and evolutionary computation. My undergraduate degree was in software engineering , nd I find the application of artificial intelligence to large amounts of data in order to derive new insight very exciting and interesting.

At present I am still trying to finalize my thesis. One of the topics I have considered would be the analysis and forecasting of financial and economic data based on the application of artificial intelligence. I am drawn to this topic based on my undergraduate experiences, in particular a course I took on artificial intelligence and a summer research project I had analyzing high frequency trading data. Another topic I have considered would be applications of evolutionary computation to solving challenging mathematical problems, I was very intrigued as an undergraduate by an example demonstrating how genetic programming can be applied to derive equations that can approximate the trigonometric functions.

I have a comprehensive computing background over many years, I have frequently written software in a multitude of different programming language as well as working with hardware, networking, security, and Unix systems. The following is a list of programming languages I have used and the estimated number of lines of code and the biggest project: Java(100,000, 10,000), C (30,000, 10,000), C++ (25,000, 5,000), Python (30,000, 10,000), PHP(20,000, 5,000), JavaScript(15,000, 2,500), R(15,000, 5,000), Ruby(10,000, 2,500), Shell(30,000, 3,000). Although I have used a lot of languages for various projects and jobs I often feel as if I have not acquired complete mastery of all aspects, core libraries, and quirks of one language. I feel most confident writing code in Java, C, and Python.
