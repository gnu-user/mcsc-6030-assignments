QUESTION 4
========================================

The following two source files: mpi_root.py and mpi_root.c contain
the implementations of the solution to question 4 using a master
slave style algorithm with MPI. Both implementations find the
approximate zero of the function f(x) and also print out the
corresponding r value for the result. Each imlementation terminates
when the subinterval width is reduced below 10E-11.


Execution
----------------------------------------

Each execution will terminate eventually, it does take a reasonable
amount of computational time before the terminating condition of
a subinterval width of 10E-11 is reached.

1. To execute the python implementation using MPI simply execute
   the following commands, you may need to explicitly specify
   the python2 environment.

   mpiexec -np 4 python2 mpi_root.py

2. To execute the C implementation you must first compile the
   code using the provided make file and then execute it
   using the following commands.

   make
   mpiexec -np 4 ./mpi_root.exe
