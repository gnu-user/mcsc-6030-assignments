QUESTION 3
========================================

The following source file, mpi_ping_pong.c and mpi_ping_pong.py 
contains the implementation of the ping-pong timing experiments
using MPI in both C and Python.


Prerequisites
----------------------------------------

Before executing the implementation you must have the BLAS/LAPACK
libraries installed on your system, follow the instructions below.

To install the BLAS/LAPACK libraries on most Ubuntu based Linux
systems simply install the following packages.

   sudo apt-get install build-essential liblapack* libblas*


Execution
----------------------------------------

To execute the ping-pong timing experiments you can either execute
each implementation manually or you can execute the benchmark script
which executes each implementation with a variety of test sizes.

1. To execute the implementation in C you can build and execute the
   code using the following commands to run a test with 1000 bytes.

   make
   mpiexec -np 2 ./mpi_ping_pong.exe 1000

2. To execute the implementation in Python you can execute the
   code using the following commands to run a test with 1000 bytes.

   mpiexec -np 2  python2 ./mpi_ping_pong.py 1000

3. If you wish to run the benchmark, which will execute both
   implementations with a variety of input sizes to test
   build the code and run the script using the following commands.

   make
   ./benchmark.sh
